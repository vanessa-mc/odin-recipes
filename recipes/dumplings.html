            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                This is a very simple version of my grandma's famous pork and shrimp dumpling recipe. 
                She does not like to give specific measurements, so just try to eye ball everything, like 
                which is what she tells me to do. It is simple and easy to recreate on your own! You can enjoy 
                these right away or store them in the freezer to enjoy later on.
                If you're a vegetarian, just omit the ground pork and substitute in 
                your favorite veggies!

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wonton wrappers</li>
                    <li>1 pound of ground pork</li>
                    <li>Ground shrimp</li>
                    <li>1 bunch of minced scallions</li>
                    <li>4 pieces of minced napa cabbage</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper for taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>    
                <ol>
                    <li>If your wonton wrappers are frozen, make sure to take them out 
                        ahead of time to let them thaw before you start.</li>
                    <li>Combine all of the meats, veggies, and seasoning into one bowl.</li>
                    <li>Take your egg and put it into a mini dish so that you can use the 
                        egg wash as a sealant while you make your dumplings.</li>
                    <li>Take one wonton wrapper and use a spoon to get one scoop of the meat 
                        and veggie mixture. Then, place it in the middle of the wrapper.</li>
                    <li>Dip a finger into the egg wash and apply it to the edges of your wrapper
                        around the meat and vegetable mixture. </li>
                    <li>Fold the wrapper in half to close the dumpling and set it aside.</li>
                    <li>You can make them fresh by steaming or dropping them in boiling water to cook.</li>
                    <li>Or you can place them in ziploc bags and place them in your freezer.</li>
                </ol>
